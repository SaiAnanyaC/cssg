                            <p>I learn a form of Indian Classical Vocal Music style known as Carnatic Music. I have been taking music lessons for this style of music since I was a child, and it has become an integral part of who I am, taught me a lot of lessons both related to music and beyond, opened me to new opportunities, and gave me a vocal foundation to learn other styles of music such as choir. I have given multiple performances, both as a solo and in a group, in local cultural and music events.</p>
